Real-World Examples of the Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a widely used design pattern that is applicable in many different contexts. Here are some real-world examples of the Observer Pattern in action:

    Event-driven programming: Many modern programming frameworks, such as JavaScriptâ€™s React and Node.js,
use the Observer Pattern to handle events and user interactions. In these frameworks, components can
register themselves as observers of specific events, and the framework will automatically notify them when those events occur.

    Stock market applications: Stock market applications often use the Observer Pattern to update users on
the latest stock prices and trends. In these applications, the stock market data is the subject, and users can register themselves
as observers to receive updates when the data changes.

    User interface design: User interfaces often use the Observer Pattern to update the display in response to user interactions.
In these applications, the user interface components are the observers, and the user input is the subject.

    Traffic management systems: Traffic management systems can use the Observer Pattern to monitor traffic conditions and a
djust traffic signals and signs accordingly. In these systems, sensors and cameras are the subjects, and the traffic management software is the observer.

    Weather monitoring systems: Weather monitoring systems often use the Observer Pattern to collect and distribute weather data.
In these systems, weather sensors and satellites are the subjects, and weather forecasting software and user interfaces are the observers.
